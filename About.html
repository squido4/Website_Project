    <div class="about">
        <p>This website was created for a project for Mission Bit. However I am using it in my English class since the issues I'm discusing relate to the website. Andrea agreed to let me present the website as my "Social Commentary", so thakkss :)

        <h1>Jose Rodriguez</h1>
            <p>I'm an undocumented immigrant student from Nochistlan, Zacatecas, a small town in Mexico. The small town was affected by Mexico's violent drug war. My parents saw that there was no opportunities for me or my brother. We left family behind and immigrated to California. I need accessible scholarships so that Iâ€™ll be able to afford my education.

        <h1>Andrea Ayala</h1>
            <p>I am from El Salvador and I have lived in San Francisco for about 9 years. I hadn't been affected by my undocumentation status until junior year when we had to start thinking about colleges. I really found making this website helpful for me and other people in the near future.</p>
